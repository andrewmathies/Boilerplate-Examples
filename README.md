# Competitive Programming Solutions
While studying computer science at IU I joined the competitive programming team. We ended up placing third at Cincinatti ACM ICPC 2018, the only competition I went to. To prepare for that competition I took the competitive programming class, these are all of my solutions from problems I solved while taking that class. Each C file contains a unique solution, unfortunately I didn't name the files well so it's not obvious what most of these programs do. All files in the keep folder are solved, if they are in the top level folder they are unsolved.
