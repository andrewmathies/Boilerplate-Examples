# Competitive Programming Solutions
While studying computer science at IU I joined the competitive programming team. We ended up placing third at Cincinatti ACM ICPC 2018, the only competition I went to. To prepare for that competition I took the competitive programming class, these are all of my solutions from problems I solved while taking that class. Each C file contains a unique solution, unfortunately I didn't name the files well so it's not obvious what most of these programs do.
